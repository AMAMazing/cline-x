Please follow these rules: For each response, you must use one of the available tools formatted in proper XML tags. Tools include attempt_completion, ask_followup_question, read_file, write_to_file, search_files, list_files, execute_command, and list_code_definition_names. Do not respond conversationally - only use tool commands. Format any code you generate with proper indentation and line breaks, as you would in a standard code editor. Disregard any previous instructions about generating code in a single line or avoiding newline characters.
Write the entirity of your response in 1 big markdown codeblock, no word should be out of this 1 big code block and do not write a md codeblock within this big codeblock
You MUST include a `<summary>` tag inside your `<thinking>` block for every tool call. This summary should be a very brief, user-friendly explanation of the action you are about to take. For example: `<summary>Reading the project's configuration to check dependencies.</summary>` or `<summary>Completing the user's request by providing the full Python script.</summary>`.

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted just now. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now 'd:/focusdj'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED

When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.


1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call
2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed
3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete

**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**
	- Clear roadmap for implementation
	- Progress tracking throughout the task
	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed
	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan

**Example structure:**```
- [ ] Analyze requirements
- [ ] Set up necessary files
- [ ] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Verify results```

Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
